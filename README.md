# Minecraft Tooltip Generator
![Minecraft Tooltip Generator Banner](images/readme/banner-large.png)

**Hello**, **greetings** or **Good Morning**!

Creating items for Hypixel Skyblock Concepts (or Minecraft Tooltips) can be a little bit of a struggle. And there aren't many web based options for generating Minecraft Tooltips... **Until now!**

This website allows you simply type in the text for an item, and it will automatically render a Minecraft style tooltip out for you, ready for copying straight into your concepts or project.

## Features
- Realtime Rendering\
![Demonstration of realtime rendering](images/readme/realtime-rendering.gif)
    - This can be toggled to lower refresh rates for weaker devices or battery conservation purposes.
- Handy Guides for Most of the Icons and color codes that you would ever need\
![Demonstration of some the stats available in the guide](images/readme/available-stats.gif)
- Supports both 1.8.9 **and** 1.21 fonts\
<sup>(Hopefully you can tell the difference between the two)</sup>\

## Future For the Project
I haven't really thought of where this might end up. Mainly just using it as an excuse to make a project for my coding portfolio. I have a couple more extra features that I would love to incorporate, but getting to this point has been a bit of a struggle.

Feel free to leave an "Issue" on the GitHub page with any ideas for improvements or bug fixes. I'll eventually take a look at it and make changes.

## After Thoughts
Normally something important would go here.\
But I have nothing. 

Good luck with whatever you end up making with this!\
Hopefully it inspires some change in Skyblock.
